\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
In this lab we were assigned multiple problems associated with control of a simulated ship. \\
The ship is simulated in MATLAB and Simulink. Control of the ship is done through MATLAB scripts. \\
We were assigned different problems raging from identifying the boat parameters, and identifying how the ship oscillates by creating a wave spectrum model. We made a PD controller for the ship and did an analisys of observability for the ship. In the end we created, and tuned, a Discrete Kalman Filter for estimating the states of the ship. \\
Labs like this are important in education of control engineers. Practical experience is essential to obtain a good understanding of a subject, and getting problems like this is therefore good. This lab grants practical experience on how to apply theory, tuning, and control systems in general.\\
This report is organized into multiple parts. The report follows the assignment manual closely, and answers the questions prompted.
