\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

The report should be similar to the helicopter lab, but since there is no oral presentation of the boat lab, more care has to be taken when presenting the results; be sure to highlight any results and make figures that clearly illustrate the results. General guidelines of what the report of the boat lab should contain can be found in Section 2 of the assignment. Although it is important to answer each question in the assignment, an answer alone is not enough. To get a good grade, write a short discussion for each part of the assignment in which you show that you understand why you obtained the results you got. Moreover, show your engineering knowledge by mentioning how a better result can be obtained (if any)

For the assignment report, content is more important than form. The assignment is not a test to show how well you can write a technical report. Moreover, single spelling mistakes or grammatical mistakes will not be penalized. However, the report should be well structured. For simplicity, write your answers for each subsection in the assignment in a separate section in the report.
