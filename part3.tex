\section{5.3 Control system design}
\subsection{a}
Choosing $T_d=T$\\
By tuning by hand we get that $K_{pd} = 0.841$ and $T_f = 8.35$ gives approximately $\omega_c = 0.10 rad/s$ and a phase margin of 50 \deg.\\
What is the advantage of using a PD-regulator, instead of a P regulator? We get less oscillations using a PD-regulator? 
A P-regulator gives overshoot.
